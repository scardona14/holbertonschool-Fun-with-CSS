# Fun with CSS

Welcome to **Fun with CSS**, an amateur-level project where we dive into the world of HTML and CSS to create some cool layouts. No JavaScript needed—just pure CSS magic!

## Project Overview

This project is all about experimenting with HTML and CSS to achieve fun and creative layouts. The key challenge? You can only use HTML and CSS, so you'll need to get creative with how you approach each task. The project is designed by **Guillaume**, CTO at Holberton School, and is weighted at **1**.

After completing your work, don't forget to request a **Manual QA review** to ensure everything is spot on!

### 1. Move the (Under)Line

**Difficulty: Advanced**

Your challenge here is to create a hidden underline that appears slowly when hovered over. The HTML is off-limits for changes, so all the action happens in the CSS!

### 2. Toggle
